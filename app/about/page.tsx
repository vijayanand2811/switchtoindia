        About Switch To India
      </h1>

      <div className="space-y-6 text-lg text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">

        <p>
          Switch To India helps people discover Indian alternatives to products they already use.
          The goal is simple — make informed choices easy.
        </p>

        <p>
          Many consumers want to support Indian companies but finding reliable information
          about ownership and origin is difficult. Brands manufacture globally,
          subsidiaries exist, and packaging rarely tells the full story.
        </p>

        <p>
          We research and organise this information so you don’t have to.
          Every recommendation focuses on product quality first,
          and Indian origin second.
        </p>

        <p>
          This is not about rejecting global products.
          It is about awareness — giving consumers clarity
          so they can choose knowingly.

          A small change in daily purchases, repeated by many people,
          can meaningfully support local innovation and manufacturing.
